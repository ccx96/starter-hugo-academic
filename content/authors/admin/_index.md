Previously, I was a postgraduate at the Xi’an Jiaotong University supervised by Prof. Jun Zhou. My research focuses on micro area electrical properties of two-dimensional phosphorus materials, based on Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy(KPFM). In addition, I also conducted micro thermal conductivity testing of polymer nanocomposites using a Scanning Thermal Microscopy(SThm).
